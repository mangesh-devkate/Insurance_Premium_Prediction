Project Title : Insurance Premium Prediction

Technologies : Machine Learning Technology

Domain : Insurance

Problem Statement: 
The goal of this project is to give people an estimate of how much they need based on
their individual health situation. After that, customers can work with any health insurance carrier and its plans and perks while keeping the projected cost from our study in mind. This can assist a person in concentrating on the health side of an insurance policy rather han the ineffective part.

Approach: 
The classical machine learning tasks like Data Exploration, Data Cleaning, Feature Engineering, Model Building and Model Testing. Try out different machine learning algorithms thatâ€™s best fit for the above case.
Some Famous Algorithms: - Linear Regression, Decision tree, Random Forest, Agaboost, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost.

Results: 
You have to build a solution that should able to predict the premium of the personal for health insurance
